# GARCH-HyperNetwork Adaptive Stacking Ensemble

Production-ready adaptive stacking ensemble integrating GARCH volatility modeling with a HyperNetwork-based meta-regulator. The system implements 20+ resiliency fixes, advanced monitoring, and modular components suited for real-time trading pipelines.

## Key Features
- 64-model adaptive stacking ensemble with asynchronous training and pruning
- Online GARCH tracking with EWMA smoothing and stress testing pipeline
- HyperNetwork-driven dynamic weighting, thresholds, and regime calibration
- Comprehensive monitoring, version control, and caching subsystems
- Docker, Prometheus, and scripting support for production deployments

See `configs/production.yaml` and `scripts/train.py` for usage examples.
